# Incident Response

## Pre-Processing (Auto-Context)

Before starting, gather project context silently:
- Read `PORTFOLIO.md` if it exists in the project root or parent directories for product/team context
- Run: `cat package.json 2>/dev/null || cat build.gradle.kts 2>/dev/null || cat Podfile 2>/dev/null` to detect stack
- Run: `git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null` for recent changes
- Run: `ls src/ app/ lib/ functions/ 2>/dev/null` to understand project structure
- Use this context to tailor all output to the actual project

Structured incident response framework for production systems. Use during active incidents, when building on-call procedures, and when conducting post-mortems. Covers Firebase, mobile, web, and API infrastructure.

## Step 1: Classify the Incident Type

| Type | Indicators | Initial Response |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Production Outage | Service unreachable, 5xx errors, health checks failing | Page on-call, open incident channel, start status page update |
| Security Breach | Unauthorized access, data exfiltration, compromised credentials | Page security lead, isolate affected systems, preserve logs |
| Data Loss | Missing records, corrupted data, failed backups, replication lag | Stop writes to affected system, assess backup state, page DBA/infra |
| Performance Degradation | Latency spikes, timeout increases, queue backlog, high error rate | Check dashboards, identify bottleneck, consider rollback |
| Third-Party Failure | Vendor API errors, DNS issues, CDN outage, payment processor down | Confirm vendor status page, activate fallback, notify customers |

## Step 2: Gather Context

1. **Affected system** -- which services, endpoints, or platforms are impacted (Firebase, Cloud Functions, mobile apps, web app)?
2. **Severity** -- how many users are affected and what is the business impact (revenue, data integrity, security)?
3. **Timeline** -- when did the issue start, when was it detected, what changed recently (deploys, config changes, traffic spikes)?
4. **Users impacted** -- total affected users, percentage of traffic, geographic scope, specific customer segments?
5. **Current state** -- is the issue ongoing, intermittent, or resolved? Is the blast radius growing?
6. **Recent changes** -- last deployment timestamp, feature flag changes, infrastructure modifications, dependency updates?

## Step 3: Severity Classification Framework

### SEV1 -- Critical (Complete Outage)
```
Impact:        Service fully down, data loss active, security breach confirmed
Users:         >50% of users affected OR any data breach
Examples:      Firebase project unreachable, production database corruption,
               leaked credentials, payment processing completely down
Response time: Immediately (within 5 minutes of detection)
Escalation:    Engineering lead + CTO + all available engineers
Communication: Status page updated within 15 minutes, customer email within 1 hour
Cadence:       Updates every 30 minutes until resolved
Bridge:        Open dedicated Slack channel (#incident-YYYY-MM-DD-short-desc)
               and Google Meet / Zoom war room
```

### SEV2 -- High (Major Degradation)
```
Impact:        Core feature broken, significant performance degradation
Users:         10-50% of users affected OR key business flow broken
Examples:      Auth failures for subset of users, Cloud Functions cold start
               timeouts, mobile app crash loop on specific OS version,
               Stripe webhook failures
Response time: Within 15 minutes of detection
Escalation:    Engineering lead + team owning affected service
Communication: Status page updated within 30 minutes, customer comm if >1 hour
Cadence:       Updates every 1 hour until resolved
Bridge:        Slack incident channel
```

### SEV3 -- Medium (Minor Degradation)
```
Impact:        Non-critical feature broken, workaround available
Users:         <10% of users affected, no revenue impact
Examples:      Analytics pipeline delayed, non-critical API slow,
               push notifications delayed, image upload failures on one platform
Response time: Within 1 hour during business hours
Escalation:    Team owning affected service
Communication: Internal Slack update, no customer communication unless asked
Cadence:       Updates every 4 hours until resolved
Bridge:        Thread in team Slack channel
```

### SEV4 -- Low (Minor Issue)
```
Impact:        Cosmetic issue, minor bug, non-user-facing system degraded
Users:         Minimal or no user impact
Examples:      CI/CD pipeline slow, staging environment down,
               log ingestion delayed, non-critical cron job failed
Response time: Next business day
Escalation:    Add to sprint backlog
Communication: Internal ticket only
Cadence:       Standard ticket updates
Bridge:        None -- track in issue tracker
```

### Escalation Paths

```
SEV1 Flow:
  Detector → On-Call Engineer (5 min) → Engineering Lead (10 min)
    → CTO (15 min) → All Hands if needed (30 min)

SEV2 Flow:
  Detector → On-Call Engineer (15 min) → Team Lead (30 min)
    → Engineering Lead if not resolved in 1 hour

SEV3 Flow:
  Detector → Team Channel → Team Lead triages within 1 hour

SEV4 Flow:
  Detector → Create ticket → Prioritize in next sprint planning
```

## Step 4: Incident Runbook Template

### Phase 1: Detection
```
Automated detection (preferred):
  - Firebase Crashlytics alerts (crash rate spike >1%)
  - Cloud Monitoring uptime checks (failure on 2+ regions)
  - Cloud Functions error rate alert (>5% error rate over 5 min)
  - Custom Datadog / Grafana dashboards with PagerDuty integration
  - Sentry error volume alerts
  - Stripe webhook failure alerts

Manual detection:
  - Customer support ticket spike
  - Social media reports
  - Internal QA or dogfooding
```

### Phase 2: Triage (First 15 Minutes)
```
1. Acknowledge the alert
   - Claim the PagerDuty / Opsgenie incident
   - Post in #incidents Slack channel: "Investigating [brief description]"

2. Assess severity using Step 3 framework
   - How many users affected?
   - Is revenue impacted?
   - Is data at risk?

3. Open incident channel if SEV1/SEV2
   - #incident-YYYY-MM-DD-[short-desc]
   - Pin initial assessment message
   - Assign roles: Incident Commander, Technical Lead, Communications Lead

4. Check recent changes
   - Last deploy: `gcloud app versions list --sort-by=~version`
   - Firebase console → Functions → Logs (last 30 min)
   - GitHub → recent merged PRs
   - Feature flag changes (LaunchDarkly / Firebase Remote Config)

5. Quick rollback decision
   - If deploy correlation is strong → rollback immediately
   - Firebase Hosting: `firebase hosting:clone SOURCE TARGET`
   - Cloud Functions: redeploy previous version from CI/CD
   - Mobile: disable feature via Remote Config (can't rollback app store)
```

### Phase 3: Mitigation (Stop the Bleeding)
```
Priority order:
  1. Rollback if deploy-related
  2. Scale up if capacity-related (Cloud Run instances, Firestore capacity)
  3. Disable feature via feature flag / Remote Config
  4. Enable maintenance mode if needed
  5. Failover to backup system if available
  6. Rate limit or block abusive traffic (Cloud Armor, WAF rules)

Firebase-specific mitigations:
  - Firestore: check and increase capacity, review security rules
  - Cloud Functions: increase memory/timeout, check concurrent execution limits
  - Hosting: rollback to previous deploy
  - Auth: check Identity Platform status, verify OAuth provider status
  - Storage: check bucket permissions, verify CORS configuration

Mobile-specific mitigations:
  - Force update via Remote Config minimum version
  - Kill switch for broken features
  - Server-side toggle to disable client-side code paths
```

### Phase 4: Resolution
```
1. Confirm the fix
   - Error rates returning to baseline
   - Latency returning to normal
   - Health checks passing
   - Manual smoke testing of affected flows

2. Monitor for recurrence
   - Watch dashboards for 30 minutes post-fix (SEV1/SEV2)
   - Confirm no secondary failures

3. Stand down
   - Update incident channel: "Resolved at [time]. Monitoring for recurrence."
   - Update status page: "Resolved"
   - Notify stakeholders

4. Preserve evidence
   - Export relevant logs before retention window
   - Screenshot dashboards showing incident timeline
   - Save any temporary debugging artifacts
```

### Phase 5: Communication
```
Internal (Slack #incidents):
  - OPENED: "[SEV-X] [System] - [Brief description]. Investigating."
  - UPDATE: "[SEV-X] [System] - [What we know]. [What we're doing]. ETA: [estimate]."
  - MITIGATED: "[SEV-X] [System] - Mitigated via [action]. Monitoring."
  - RESOLVED: "[SEV-X] [System] - Resolved at [time]. Root cause: [brief]. Post-mortem scheduled."

External (status page / customer email):
  - Use Step 6 templates below
```

## Step 5: On-Call Procedures

### Rotation Schedule
```
Structure:
  - Primary on-call: 1 week rotation (Monday 10AM → Monday 10AM)
  - Secondary on-call: backup, escalation target
  - Minimum 2 people in rotation per team
  - No back-to-back weeks
  - Handoff meeting: 15 min at rotation start (review open issues, recent deploys)

Expectations:
  - Acknowledge alerts within 5 minutes (SEV1/SEV2)
  - Acknowledge alerts within 15 minutes (SEV3)
  - Laptop and internet access required (no airplane mode)
  - Response SLA: 15 minutes to begin investigation
  - If unreachable after 10 minutes → auto-escalate to secondary
```

  - Required for all SEV1 and SEV2 incidents
  - Optional but encouraged for SEV3
  - Draft due within 48 hours of resolution
  - Review meeting within 5 business days
  - Action items tracked in issue tracker with due dates
  - Action item completion reviewed in engineering standup
```

## Step 8: Incident Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

```
MTTD (Mean Time to Detect):
  Definition: Time from incident start to first detection (alert or human)
  Target: <5 minutes for SEV1, <15 minutes for SEV2
  Measure: Timestamp of first symptom → timestamp of first alert/report
  Improve: Better monitoring, tighter alert thresholds, synthetic monitoring

MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve):
  Definition: Time from detection to full resolution
  Target: <1 hour for SEV1, <4 hours for SEV2
  Measure: Timestamp of detection → timestamp of confirmed resolution
  Improve: Better runbooks, faster rollbacks, automated remediation

MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge):
  Definition: Time from alert firing to engineer acknowledging
  Target: <5 minutes for SEV1/SEV2
  Measure: PagerDuty/Opsgenie acknowledgment timestamps
  Improve: Pager configuration, on-call hygiene, escalation policies

MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):
  Definition: Average time between incidents for a given system
  Target: Increasing quarter over quarter
  Measure: Track per-system, per-severity
  Improve: Address root causes from post-mortems, invest in reliability

Incident Frequency by Severity:
  Track monthly:
    - Total incidents per severity level
    - Incidents per system/service
    - Incidents by root cause category
    - Repeat incidents (same root cause)
  Target: Decreasing trend, zero repeat incidents
```

### Metrics Dashboard
```
Recommended tooling:
  - Datadog / Grafana for real-time operational dashboards
  - PagerDuty Analytics for on-call and response metrics
  - Google Sheets or Notion for monthly incident tracking
  - BigQuery for long-term incident data analysis

Monthly review checklist:
  - [ ] Total incidents by severity (trend vs. prior months)
  - [ ] MTTD, MTTA, MTTR averages by severity
  - [ ] Top 3 systems by incident count
  - [ ] Open action items from post-mortems (% completion)
  - [ ] On-call load distribution (pages per person)
  - [ ] False positive alert rate (target: <10%)
  - [ ] Repeat incident rate (target: 0%)

Quarterly reliability report:
  - MTBF trend per critical system
  - Incident cost estimate (engineer hours * hourly cost + revenue impact)
  - SLA compliance percentage
  - Top action item themes (monitoring, testing, process, architecture)
  - Reliability investment recommendations for next quarter
```

## Code Generation (Required)

Generate incident management artifacts using Write:

1. **Runbook template**: `docs/runbooks/template.md` with the standard Cure format
2. **Post-mortem template**: `docs/post-mortems/template.md`
3. **PagerDuty webhook**: `functions/src/incident-webhook.ts` (Cloud Function that creates incident records)
4. **Slack notification**: Generate Slack Block Kit JSON for incident announcements
5. **Status page update script**: `scripts/update-status.sh`

Before generating, Glob for existing runbooks and post-mortems to match format.
